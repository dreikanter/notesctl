# notes

A command-line tool for managing a plain-text note archive you own entirely.

Every note is a markdown file in a date-stamped folder (`2026/04/20260405_9522.md`). No database, no proprietary format, no account — just files on disk, synced however you like (Dropbox, git, rsync, nothing at all). The CLI gives you fast, scriptable access to the archive from the terminal:

- **Create** notes with optional title, tags, slug, and type
- **List and filter** by type, tag, slug, or date
- **Read, append, annotate** without leaving the shell
- **Resolve** a note (by ID, type, slug, or tag) to an absolute path — so the tool composes with everything Unix already has

The tool doesn't try to be a knowledge graph, a publishing platform, or a second brain app. It covers a deliberately small scope:

1. **Capture** — get text into a file quickly (`echo "..." | notes new`)
2. **Retrieve** — find it again by ID, type, tag, or slug
3. **Integrate** — pipe notes into other tools, scripts, and AI assistants

Think of it as the storage layer that sits underneath your workflow, not the workflow itself. Obsidian and Logseq are rich GUIs built around their own vaults. notes is closer to a structured `~/notes` directory with a fast command-line interface on top — no plugins, no sync service, no lock-in. The files are yours; the CLI is optional convenience.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/dreikanter/notes/cmd/notes@latest
```

Make sure `~/go/bin` is on your `PATH`:

```sh
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

For development, use `make build` or `make install` from a local clone.

## Usage

Commands take a note's numeric ID (printed by `new`, `ls`, `resolve`, etc.).
To act on "the most recent note of type X" or "the most recent note with slug
Y", use `notes resolve` or `notes ls --limit 1` to turn a filter into an ID
and compose with shell substitution.

```sh
# Create a new note
notes new
notes new --title "Meeting notes" --slug meeting --tag work
notes new --type todo --upsert   # create or return existing today's todo

# Create today's todo (rolls over pending tasks from the previous one)
notes new-todo

# List note IDs, newest first
notes ls
notes ls --limit 10
notes ls --type todo
notes ls --slug meeting
notes ls --tag work
notes ls --tag work --tag meeting     # multiple --tag flags are ANDed
notes ls --public
notes ls --today

# Resolve a note and print its absolute path (exactly one lookup flag, or none)
notes resolve                    # most recent note overall
notes resolve --id 8823          # by exact numeric ID
notes resolve --type todo        # most recent note of that type
notes resolve --slug meeting     # most recent note with that slug
notes resolve --tag work         # most recent note with that tag

# Read one or more notes by numeric ID
notes read 8823
notes read 8823 8818
notes read 8823 --no-frontmatter
notes read 8823 8818 --json

# Fill empty frontmatter (title, description, tags) using Claude Code CLI
notes annotate 8823
notes annotate 8823 --model claude-sonnet-4-6
notes annotate 8823 --max-chars 4000   # truncate body before sending
notes annotate 8823 --timeout 2m       # override the 60s default

# Append stdin text to a note
echo "text" | notes append 8823

# Delete a note
notes rm 8823

# Update frontmatter (file is renamed automatically when slug, type, or date changes)
notes update 8823 --title "New Title"
notes update 8823 --description "One-line summary"
notes update 8823 --tag work --tag planning
notes update 8823 --no-tags
notes update 8823 --slug meeting
notes update 8823 --no-slug
notes update 8823 --type todo
notes update 8823 --no-type
notes update 8823 --date 20260420        # move to a different day (YYYYMMDD)
notes update 8823 --public
notes update 8823 --private

# List all tags (frontmatter + body hashtags)
notes tags
notes tags list                     # explicit alias

# Rename a tag across the whole store
notes tags rename work personal
notes tags rename --dry-run work personal

# Delete a tag across the whole store (frontmatter dropped, body '#name' becomes 'name')
notes tags rm work
notes tags rm --dry-run work

# Print the effective runtime configuration (resolved store path, defaults, env vars)
notes config

# Print an AI-assistant skill describing how to drive notes
notes skill
notes skill --install                 # auto-detect skills roots, install into each
notes skill --install --target=codex  # install into a specific target (codex, claude, pi, agents)
notes skill --install --dry-run       # show planned actions, write nothing
notes skill --install --force         # overwrite a diverging existing skill
```

Composing with the shell — since most commands take an ID, use `ls` or
`resolve` to turn a filter into one:

```sh
# Append to the most recent note with a given slug
echo "text" | notes append "$(notes ls --slug claude-sessions --limit 1)"

# Read the most recent todo
notes read "$(notes ls --type todo --limit 1)"

# Open the most recent meeting note in $EDITOR
$EDITOR "$(notes resolve --slug meeting)"
```

The notes store path is resolved in this order:

1. `--path` flag
2. `NOTES_PATH` environment variable

If neither is set, `notes` exits with an error. There is no implicit default —
set `NOTES_PATH` (e.g. `export NOTES_PATH=~/notes`) or pass `--path`.

## Development

```sh
make build       # build local ./notes binary
make install     # build and install to ~/go/bin/notes
make test        # run all tests
make lint        # run golangci-lint
make clean       # remove built binary
```

Run a single test:

```sh
go test ./note/ -run TestParseFilename -v
```

## Versioning

`CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth for the version. On PR merge, GitHub
Actions (`.github/workflows/tag.yml`) reads the topmost `## [X.Y.Z]` heading
from `CHANGELOG.md` and pushes `vX.Y.Z` as a git tag. Bump major/minor/patch
by writing the desired heading in the PR.

After merging, pull and reinstall locally:

```sh
make update
```
